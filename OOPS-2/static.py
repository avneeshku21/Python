# Static Variables(Vs Instance variables)

# In Python, a static variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class, rather than being unique to each instance. It is also sometimes referred to as a class variable, because it belongs to the class itself rather than any particular instance of the class.

# static vs instance

# instance varibale object ka hota hai

# static - static varibale ka value har object k liye same hota hai
